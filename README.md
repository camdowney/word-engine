# Word Engine
Stuck on your current guess in Wordle? Simply input your board and Word Engine will automatically narrow down which words are possible!

## Instructions
1. Type or use the on-screen keyboard to add and remove letters to/from the board
2. Click on a filled board cell to cycle through colors
3. Match the board exactly to your Wordle board (both letters and colors)
4. That's it - Word Engine will reveal which words are possible!

*Note that Word Engine feeds possible words from a list that includes ALL five-letter words in the English dictionary. As such, some words that are provided may not be valid in Wordle.*

Word Engine's user interface is made reactive with [Neutro](https://github.com/camdowney/neutro).
