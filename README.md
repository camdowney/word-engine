# Word Engine
Word Engine is a demo application that integrates [Neutro](https://github.com/camdowney/neutro). It can be used to narrow down possible five-letter words in the popular web game Wordle. Simply type some letters and click the boxes to cycle through colors, and the suggestions will be filtered automagically.

More documentation coming soon.
