# Word Engine
Word Engine is a utility application that integrates [Neutro](https://github.com/camdowney/neutro). It can be used to narrow down possible five-letter words in Wordle. Simply type some letters and click the boxes to cycle through colors, match the board to your current board in Wordle, and the suggestions will be filtered automatically.

More documentation coming soon.
